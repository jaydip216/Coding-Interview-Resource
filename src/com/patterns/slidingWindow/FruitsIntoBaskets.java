/*
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
 * you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. 
 * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * 
 * example
 * 
 * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
